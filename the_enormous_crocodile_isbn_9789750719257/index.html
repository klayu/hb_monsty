Overall, The Witches is a must-read for young children. The engaging story, combined with the whimsical illustrations, makes it an excellent addition to any child&rsquo;s library. I highly recommend buying this book to enjoy with your little ones and teach them valuable life lessons while having fun.</br></br></p>
