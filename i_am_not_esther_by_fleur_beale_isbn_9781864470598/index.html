<p>Title: I Am Not Esther</br>
Author: Fleur Beale</br></br>
Review: I Am Not Esther is a captivating children&rsquo;s book written by Fleur Beale, which tells the story of a young girl named Kirby who is forced to live with her estranged relatives after her mother&rsquo;s sudden death. The book primarily targets children between the ages of 8 and 12 years old, as it explores themes of family, friendship, and self-discovery.</br></br>
The story is set in a religious community where the relatives Kirby is living with are strict followers of a religious leader called &ldquo;The Prophet.&rdquo; Kirby, who is unfamiliar with their customs and beliefs, struggles to fit in and accept her new life. As she navigates this unfamiliar world, she begins to question her own identity and beliefs.</br></br>
One of the most notable aspects of I Am Not Esther is the way it addresses the importance of individuality and self-expression. Through Kirby&rsquo;s journey, readers learn the value of staying true to oneself, even in the face of adversity. Additionally, the book touches upon the concepts of friendship, trust, and the power of standing up for what is right.</br></br>
The writing style of Fleur Beale is engaging and relatable, making it easy for young readers to connect with the characters and their experiences. The book also provides an opportunity for parents and educators to initiate discussions on various life lessons, such as the importance of empathy, understanding, and resilience.</br></br>
My thoughts, I Am Not Esther is a well-written and thought-provoking children&rsquo;s book that would be a valuable addition to any young reader&rsquo;s library. I highly recommend this book for children aged 8 to 12, as it offers an engaging storyline that encourages self-discovery and promotes essential life lessons.</br></br></p>

Review: The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, is a captivating children&rsquo;s book that explores themes of individuality, memory, and the importance of emotions. The story is set in a seemingly utopian society where pain, suffering, and conflict have been eradicated, but at the cost of personal freedom and the ability to experience true emotions.</br></br>
The book primarily targets children between the ages of 10 and 14 years old, as it delves into complex themes and ideas that may be challenging for younger readers.

In this role, Jonas learns about the past and the true nature of emotions, which have been suppressed in his society.</br></br>
One of the most notable aspects of The Giver is the way it addresses the importance of individuality and the value of emotions. Through Jonas&rsquo;s journey, readers learn the significance of embracing one&rsquo;s unique qualities and the importance of experiencing a full range of emotions, both positive and negative. Additionally, the book touches upon the concepts of free will, personal choice, and the consequences of a society that prioritizes conformity over individuality.</br></br>

<p>Title: To Kill a Mockingbird</br></br>
Review: To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a timeless children&rsquo;s book that explores themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of empathy. The story primarily targets children between the ages of 12 and 18 years old, as it delves into complex themes and ideas that may be challenging for younger readers.</br></br>
The book follows the journey of a young girl named Scout Finch, who lives in a small Southern town during the 1930s. Through Scout&rsquo;s experiences and the eyes of her father, Atticus Finch, readers learn about the harsh realities of racial prejudice, social inequality, and the importance of standing up for what is right.</br></br>
One of the most notable aspects of To Kill a Mockingbird is the way it addresses the importance of empathy and understanding. Through Scout&rsquo;s experiences, readers learn the significance of looking beyond surface-level differences and recognizing the shared humanity that connects us all. Additionally, the book touches upon the concepts of justice, moral courage, and the dangers of unquestioned tradition and prejudice.</br></br>
The writing style of Harper Lee is engaging and thought-provoking, making it easy for young readers to connect with the characters and their experiences. The book also provides an opportunity for parents and educators to initiate discussions on various life lessons, such as the importance of empathy, understanding, and the pursuit of justice.</br></br>
My thoughts, To Kill a Mockingbird is a well-written and thought-provoking children&rsquo;s book that would be a valuable addition to any young reader&rsquo;s library. I highly recommend this book for children aged 12 to 18, as it offers an engaging storyline that encourages self-discovery and promotes essential life lessons.</br></br></p>
