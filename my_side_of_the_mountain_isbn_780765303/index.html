My thoughts, The Call of the Wild is a wonderful book that offers an exciting adventure while teaching valuable life lessons. I highly recommend this book for children aged 8-12 years old, as it will not only entertain them but also help them develop a deeper appreciation for nature, loyalty, and the importance of perseverance.</br></br></p>
