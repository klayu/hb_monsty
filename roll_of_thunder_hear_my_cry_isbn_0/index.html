<p>Title: Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</br>
Author: Mildred D. Taylor</br>
Age Group: 10-14 years old</br></br>
Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a captivating novel by Mildred D. Taylor that tells the story of a young African American girl named Cassie Logan, who lives with her family in Mississippi during the 1930s.

The story follows Cassie as she navigates the complexities of racism, prejudice, and injustice, while also learning the importance of family, love, and standing up for what is right. Through her experiences, Cassie learns valuable life lessons that will resonate with readers of all ages.</br></br>
One of the key themes in the book is the importance of education. Cassie&rsquo;s parents, along with other African American families, establish their own school, as they are not allowed to attend the white school. This highlights the determination and resilience of the African American community in the face of adversity.</br></br>
Another important theme is the power of unity and standing up for one&rsquo;s beliefs. Cassie witnesses her family and community members come together to support each other in the face of injustice, teaching her the importance of solidarity and fighting for what is right.</br></br>
