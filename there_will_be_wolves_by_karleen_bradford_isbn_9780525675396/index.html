<p>Title: The Giver</br></br>
Review: The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, is a thought-provoking children&rsquo;s book that explores themes of individuality, memory, and the importance of emotions. The book is primarily targeted at children between the ages of 10 and 14, and it offers valuable life lessons that will resonate with young readers.</br></br>
The story follows the protagonist, Jonas, who lives in a seemingly perfect society where everyone is equal and there is no pain or suffering. However, as Jonas is selected to be the Receiver of Memory, he learns the dark secrets of his community and the importance of individuality and emotions.</br></br>
One of the key themes in the book is the importance of embracing one&rsquo;s emotions.
