<p>Title: Noughts &amp; Crosses</br>
Author: Malorie Blackman</br></br>
Review: Noughts &amp; Crosses is a captivating and thought-provoking children&rsquo;s book written by Malorie Blackman. The story is set in a dystopian society where the roles of the historically oppressed and the oppressors are reversed, with the Crosses being the dominant race and the Noughts being the oppressed.</br></br>
The book follows the lives of two main characters, Callum and Sephy, who come from different racial backgrounds and face numerous challenges due to the prejudices and inequalities of their society. Throughout the book, Blackman explores themes of love, friendship, and the struggle for equality, as Callum and Sephy&rsquo;s relationship is tested by the harsh realities of their world.</br></br>
Noughts &amp; Crosses is recommended for children aged 12 and up, as it tackles mature themes such as racism, violence, and the struggle for justice. The book teaches valuable life lessons, such as the importance of empathy, understanding, and the power of individual action to bring about change.</br></br>
Blackman&rsquo;s writing style is both engaging and thought-provoking, making the story accessible to young readers while still conveying the gravity of the situations Callum and Sephy face. The characters are relatable and engaging, particularly Callum and Sephy, who demonstrate remarkable courage and resilience in the face of adversity.</br></br>
My final thoughts, Noughts &amp; Crosses is a must-read for young readers interested in learning about the importance of empathy, understanding, and the fight for equality. The book is a perfect blend of adventure, emotion, and education, making it an excellent addition to any child&rsquo;s library. I highly recommend purchasing this book for your young reader to enjoy and learn from.</br></br></p>
