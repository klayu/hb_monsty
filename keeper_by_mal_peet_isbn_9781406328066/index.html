<p>Title: Between Shades of Gray</br>
Author: Ruta Sepetys</br></br>
Review: Between Shades of Gray, written by Ruta Sepetys, is a powerful and heart-wrenching novel that tells the story of Lina, a young Lithuanian girl, and her family&rsquo;s struggle to survive during the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. The story follows Lina&rsquo;s journey as she navigates the harsh realities of life in a labor camp, the loss of her loved ones, and the hope for a better future.</br></br>
The book is targeted towards children aged 12 and older, as it explores mature themes such as war, oppression, and the resilience of the human spirit. The story is written in a gripping and thought-provoking manner, making it an engaging read for young adults.</br></br>
One of the strengths of Between Shades of Gray is its ability to delve into the complexities of war, the impact of political oppression, and the importance of family and hope in the face of adversity. The book also highlights the importance of perseverance, empathy, and the power of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.</br></br>
My thoughts, Between Shades of Gray is a must-read for young adults who are interested in exploring themes of war, oppression, and the resilience of the human spirit. The book teaches valuable life lessons while keeping the reader engaged with its gripping plot and relatable characters. I highly recommend this book for children aged 12 and older and believe it would make a great addition to any young reader&rsquo;s library.</br></br></p>
