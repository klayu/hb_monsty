Through Meursault&rsquo;s experiences and his reactions to the events around him, readers are encouraged to question their own beliefs and the nature of human existence.</br></br>
The book also touches upon themes of morality, the meaning of justice, and the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions. As Meursault navigates the world around him, readers are challenged to think deeply about their own lives and the choices they make.</br></br>
The Stranger is a beautifully written and thought-provoking novel that offers valuable life lessons and an engaging story that will stay with readers for years to come. I highly recommend this book for children aged 14 and above, as it provides a rich and captivating reading experience that will leave a lasting impression.</br></br></p>
