In summary, Not a Box is a wonderful children&rsquo;s book that is both entertaining and educational. It is suitable for children between the ages of 2 and 5 years old and covers essential life lessons that are important for their growth and development. I highly recommend this book for parents, teachers, and anyone looking to introduce young readers to the joys of storytelling and valuable life lessons.</br></br></p>
