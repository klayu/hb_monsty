Title: Old Bear</br>
Author: Kevin Henkes</br></br>
Review: Old Bear is a heartwarming children's book written and illustrated by Kevin Henkes. The story revolves around a young girl named Emily, who is given a stuffed bear as a gift by her grandmother. The bear, named Old Bear, is well-loved by Emily and becomes her constant companion.</br></br>
The book is targeted towards children between the ages of 4 to 8 years old. The illustrations are beautifully done, with soft colors and charming details that will captivate young readers. The story is simple yet meaningful, and it teaches valuable life lessons about friendship, love, and the importance of cherished objects.</br></br>
One of the key themes in Old Bear is the power of imagination. Emily's relationship with Old Bear is based on the strong bond they share, and it is through her imagination that she is able to bring the bear to life. This aspect of the story encourages children to embrace their own creativity and to explore the world of make-believe.</br></br>
Another important lesson in Old Bear is the idea of growing up and letting go. As Emily gets older, she starts to outgrow her attachment to Old Bear. This transition teaches children about the natural process of change and how it is essential to move forward in life.</br></br>
My reccomendation, Old Bear is a delightful children's book that offers a charming story, beautiful illustrations, and valuable life lessons. I highly recommend this book for children aged 4 to 8 years old, as it will surely capture their hearts and inspire their imaginations.</br></br>
