Title: Animal Farm</br></br>
Animal Farm, written by George Orwell, is a thought-provoking and allegorical tale that uses the lives of farm animals to comment on the events leading up to the Russian Revolution and the early years of the Soviet Union.</br></br>
The target age group for this book is children between the ages of 12 and 16 years old. The story is engaging and easy to understand, making it a perfect read for young readers. However, the underlying themes and symbolism in the book make it more suitable for older children who can better grasp the complex ideas presented.</br></br>

The animals on the farm initially believe in the ideals of Animalism, but as the pigs gain more power, they begin to manipulate and control the other animals. This teaches children the value of being skeptical and not blindly following those in positions of power.</br></br>
Another important lesson covered in the book is the concept of power corrupting individuals. The pigs, who initially fought for equality among the animals, eventually become just as tyrannical as the humans they replaced. This demonstrates the idea that power can lead to corruption and the abuse of authority.</br></br>
Overall, Animal Farm is a thought-provoking and engaging children's book that teaches valuable life lessons in a fun and accessible way. I highly recommend this book for older readers and believe it would make a wonderful addition to any child's library.</br></br>
