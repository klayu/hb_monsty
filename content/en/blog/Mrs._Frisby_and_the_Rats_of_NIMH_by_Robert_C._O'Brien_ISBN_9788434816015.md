Throughout the book, Mrs. Frisby encounters various obstacles and challenges, but with the help of her newfound friends, she learns to overcome them.</br></br>
One of the most striking aspects of the book is the way it presents the rats as intelligent and compassionate creatures, highlighting the idea that animals are not just mere objects, but rather sentient beings capable of feeling emotions and making decisions. This theme encourages children to develop empathy and respect for all living creatures.</br></br>
The writing style is engaging and easy to understand, making it an enjoyable read for children and adults alike. The book also contains illustrations that help bring the story to life and enhance the reader's experience.</br></br>
