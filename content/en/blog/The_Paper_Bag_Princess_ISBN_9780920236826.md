The Paper Bag Princess is a delightful children's book written by Robert Munsch and illustrated by Michael Martchenko. This story is a refreshing twist on traditional fairy tales, as it teaches children important life lessons while also providing a fun and engaging narrative.</br></br>
The book is suitable for children aged 4 to 8 years old. It follows the adventures of Princess Elizabeth, who is set to marry Prince Ronald. However, a dragon attacks the castle, kidnaps Prince Ronald, and burns down everything, including Elizabeth's beautiful clothes. Undeterred, Elizabeth dons a paper bag and sets out to rescue her prince.</br></br>
Throughout the story, Elizabeth demonstrates bravery, intelligence, and self-confidence, which are essential qualities for young readers to learn and emulate.
