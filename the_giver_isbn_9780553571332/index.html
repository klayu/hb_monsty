Through Thomas&rsquo;s journey, readers learn that it is essential to rely on others and work together to overcome challenges. The book also highlights the significance of self-discovery and the courage to face the unknown.</br></br>
Personal thoughts, The Maze Runner is a must-read for young adults and adults alike. Its captivating storyline, relatable characters, and thrilling adventure make it an excellent addition to any bookshelf. I highly recommend this book for readers aged 12 and up.</br></br></p>
