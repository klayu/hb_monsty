The life lessons covered in The 5th Wave include the importance of resilience, self-sacrifice, and the power of determination. The book also explores themes of friendship, love, and the consequences of war.</br></br>
My reccomendation, The 5th Wave is a must-read for young adults who enjoy action-packed stories with strong themes of survival and courage. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting and thought-provoking read.</br></br></p>
