Personal thoughts, Murder on the Orient Express is a thrilling children&rsquo;s book that is sure to captivate young readers with its engaging storyline, beautiful illustrations, and valuable life lessons. I highly recommend this book for children aged 10 to 14 years old, and it would make a wonderful addition to any child&rsquo;s library.</br></br></p>
