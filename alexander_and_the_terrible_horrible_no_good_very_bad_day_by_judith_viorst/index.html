The True Story of the Three Little Pigs is a clever and entertaining children&rsquo;s book written by Jon Scieszka and illustrated by Lane Smith. This book is perfect for children between the ages of 4 and 8 years old.</br></br>
The story is a retelling of the classic fairy tale from the perspective of the wolf, who claims that he was framed for the destruction of the three little pigs&rsquo; houses. The wolf explains that he was just trying to borrow a cup of sugar from the pigs, but due to a series of unfortunate events, he ended up being labeled as the &ldquo;Big Bad Wolf.&quot;</br></br>
The illustrations by Lane Smith are whimsical and engaging, capturing the wolf&rsquo;s emotions and the comedic situations he finds himself in. The text is easy to read and understand, making it a great book for early readers.</br></br>

The wolf&rsquo;s story teaches children that there are often two sides to every story, and it is essential to consider different viewpoints before making judgments. This message is crucial for young readers, as it teaches them the value of empathy and open-mindedness.</br></br>
Personal thoughts, The True Story of the Three Little Pigs is a must-read for children between the ages of 4 and 8 years old.
