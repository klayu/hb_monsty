My reccomendation, I highly recommend The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time for children between the ages of 12 and 15. This book offers a unique and insightful perspective on the challenges faced by individuals with autism and the importance of understanding and embracing neurodiversity.</br></br></p>
