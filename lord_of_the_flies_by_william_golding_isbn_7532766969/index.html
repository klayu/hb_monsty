The characters are well-developed, and the reader can easily empathize with their struggles and fears.</br></br>
The Maze Runner teaches valuable life lessons about the importance of cooperation, the power of determination, and the resilience of the human spirit. It encourages readers to reflect on their own values and the consequences of their actions.</br></br>
My thoughts, The Maze Runner is a must-read for young adults who are interested in exploring complex themes and ideas. The book is a thrilling and thought-provoking masterpiece that will leave a lasting impression on its readers. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.</br></br></p>
